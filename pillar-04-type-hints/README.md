# Pillar 04 — Type Hints & Static Typing

This pillar covers static typing in Python with a focus on ML code:

- Type annotations for functions and data structures used in ML
- Generic types for tensor-like data and model outputs
- Protocols to define model interfaces without inheritance
- Pydantic models for configuration and input validation

Folders:
- examples/ — example modules illustrating typing patterns
- project/ — a small project: fully-typed ML pipeline

Project
- Build a fully-typed ML pipeline (preprocessing, training, evaluation) that uses Protocols for model interfaces and Pydantic for config validation.
