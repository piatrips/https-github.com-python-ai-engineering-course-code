# Pillar 07: Type Checking with MyPy

## Overview

This pillar covers static type checking in Python using MyPy:
- Type annotations and hints
- Generic types and type variables
- Protocol classes
- Type checking configuration
- Gradual typing strategies

## Contents

- **examples/**: Code examples demonstrating type annotations
- **labs/**: Hands-on exercises for adding type hints
- **project/**: A comprehensive typed Python project
- **solutions/**: Solutions to lab exercises

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this pillar, you will be able to:
- Add type annotations to Python code
- Use MyPy for static type checking
- Work with generic types and protocols
- Configure MyPy for different projects
- Apply gradual typing to existing codebases

## Getting Started

Navigate to the `examples/` directory to see practical demonstrations of the concepts covered in this pillar.
