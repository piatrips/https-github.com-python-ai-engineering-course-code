# Pillar 02: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This pillar explores Python's data structures and fundamental algorithms:
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- List comprehensions
- Common algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Time and space complexity
- Algorithm optimization

## Contents

- **examples/**: Code examples demonstrating data structures and algorithms
- **labs/**: Hands-on exercises to practice implementing algorithms
- **project/**: A comprehensive project applying data structures
- **solutions/**: Solutions to lab exercises

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this pillar, you will be able to:
- Effectively use Python's built-in data structures
- Implement common algorithms
- Analyze algorithm complexity
- Choose appropriate data structures for different problems
- Optimize code performance
